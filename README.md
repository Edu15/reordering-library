## Non-Specultive Data-Driven Parallelizations of Irregular Algorithms for Sparse Matrices Reordering

This project aims the parallelization of some algorithms for the bandwidth and wavefront reduction problems. 
The related algorithms are:
* Reverse Cuthill McKee - RCM (Bandwidth Reduction)
* Sloan (Wavefront Reduction)

### Dependencies
On linux, execute the command to install libraries used by the program:

<code>
sudo apt-get install cmake libboost-all-dev gfortran libblas-dev
