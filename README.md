## Parallelization of Reordering Algorithms for Bandwidth and Wavefront Reduction of Large Sparse Matrices

This project aims the parallelization of some algorithms for the bandwidth and wavefront reduction problems. 
The related algorithms are:
* Reverse Cuthill McKee - RCM (Bandwidth Reduction)
* Sloan (Wavefront Reduction)
